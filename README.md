# Grand Challenge on Video Super-Resolution for Video Conferencing - ICME 2025
[[challenge website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/video-super-resolution-challenge-icme-2025/challenge/)]

The Grand Challenge on Video Super-Resolution for Video Conferencing at ICME 2025 is intended to stimulate research in the area of Video Super Resolution in communication systems.

This ICME grand challenge focuses on video super-resolution for video conferencing, where the low-resolution video is encoded using the H.265 codec with fixed Quantization Parameters (QP). The goal is to upscale the input LR videos by a specific factor and provide HR videos with perceptually enhanced quality (including compression artifact removal). We follow the low-delay scenario in the entire challenge, where **no future frames should be used to enhance the current frame**.

There are three tracks specific to video content:

- [**Track 1**: General purpose real-world video content](docs/track1.md), x4 upscaling
- [**Track 2**: Talking Head videos](docs/track2.md), x4 upscaling
- [**Track 3**: Screen sharing videos](docs/track3.md), x3 upscaling

This repository aims to provide the **training set** and **validation set** for each track. The test sets will be provided close to the end of the competition to the registered teams.
